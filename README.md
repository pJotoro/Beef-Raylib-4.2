# Beef-Raylib-4.2

Make sure to set "C Library" to "Dynamic Debug" for debug builds and "Dynamic" for release builds. This includes the corelib.

I have set up the bindings to choose the correct version of raylib (debug or release) for you based on whether you're in debug or release mode, so you don't have to worry about that.
